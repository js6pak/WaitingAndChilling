# WaitingAndChilling
A *SixModLoader fork of* SCP:SL plugin that spawns players in a lobby during the `Waiting for players...` phase of the round.

Players are spawned in a lobby as tutorials. This is just to entertain people while waiting for other players.

Config is automatically generated with comments.

**This mod fakes lobby timer so clients will think that round is started (to get rid of lobby window), this can cause mod incompatibilities**
